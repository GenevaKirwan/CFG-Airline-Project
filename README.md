# CFG-Airline-Project


## Breakdown of Files
### Final Code File:
The final code for this project can be found in ProjectCode.ipynb. In order to run this code, the file should be downloaded as well as the Associated Data Files and run in Jupyter Notebook. Headings and Markdowns included within the code will allow you to follow through the analysis process.   

### Associated Data Files:
The input data files required for the code have been included within this branch where possible, these files include:
* 1053933928_T_F41SCHEDULE_B43.csv
* Fuel-DataEmissions-Table.csv

In some cases due to file size data has not been added to this GitHub branch. In these cases the data MUST be downloaded and saved in the same folder as the other data files BEFORE the code is run:
*
### Files Outputted by Code:
The code will output some files whilst it runs in case this data is required. If not needed these generated files can be deleted, this will not prevent the code from running future iterations. 

### Report File:


### Presentation:


## Python and Library Requirement
